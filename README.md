## 🎯 Key Design Choices

### **1. Multi-Task Learning Architecture**
```python
# Separate models for different tasks
self.issue_type_model = RandomForestClassifier(...)  # 94.1% accuracy
self.urgency_model = RandomForestClassifier(...)     # 37.9% accuracy
```
**Rationale**: Independent optimization, flexible handling of missing labels, robust failure isolation

### **2. Algorithm Selection: Random Forest**
```python
RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,
    class_weight='balanced',  # Handle class imbalance
    random_state=42
)
```
**Why Random Forest**:
- ✅ Excellent baseline performance (94.1% vs 89.2% Logistic Regression)
- ✅ Built-in feature importance analysis
- ✅ Robust to overfitting through ensemble approach
- ✅ Handles mixed data types (text + numerical features)

### **3. Hybrid Feature Engineering**
```python
# Primary: TF-IDF text features
TfidfVectorizer(max_features=5000, ngram_range=(1, 2))

# Secondary: Engineered features
- text_length, word_count
- sentiment_polarity, sentiment_subjectivity
- has_urgent_words (domain knowledge)
```
**Strategy**: Combine proven NLP techniques with domain-specific features

### **4. Rule-Based Entity Extraction**
```python
# High precision approach
for product in self.products:
    if product.lower() in text.lower():
        entities['products'].append(product)
```
**Trade-off**: 100% precision on known patterns vs. potential recall limitations

### **5. Comprehensive Preprocessing Pipeline**
```python
# Preserve meaning while reducing noise
text → lowercase → remove special chars → tokenize →
remove stopwords → lemmatize → rejoin
```
**Design**: Balance between noise reduction and information preservation

- **Feature Importance**: TF-IDF and engineered feature analysis

## 🚧 Limitations & Future Improvements

### **Current Limitations**

#### **1. Data Quality Issues (Primary Concern)**
```
❌ Urgency Labeling Inconsistencies:
- "Payment problem. Need urgent help." → Low urgency
- "Can you tell me about warranty?" → High urgency
- Identical texts with different urgency labels
```
**Impact**: 37.9% urgency accuracy reflects data quality, not model capability

#### **2. Entity Extraction Constraints**
```python
# Current: Simple string matching
"SmartWatch V2" ✅ detected
"Smart Watch"   ❌ missed (space variation)
"SW V2"         ❌ missed (abbreviation)
```
**Limitation**: ~15-20% recall loss due to variations and misspellings

#### **3. Scalability Constraints**
- **Memory**: TF-IDF matrix grows with vocabulary (current: 5000 features)
- **Training Time**: O(n log n) complexity for Random Forest
- **Real-time**: 200ms prediction time (acceptable for current scale)

#### **4. Domain Adaptation**
- **Fixed Product List**: Manual updates required for new products
- **English Only**: No multi-language support
- **Customer Support Context**: Not generalizable to other domains

### **Improvement Roadmap**

#### **Short-term (1-2 weeks)**
- ✅ **Data Cleaning**: Rule-based urgency corrections
- ✅ **Enhanced Features**: More text-based urgency indicators
- ✅ **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple algorithms

#### **Medium-term (1-2 months)**
- 🔄 **Advanced NER**: spaCy-based entity extraction
- 🔄 **Deep Learning**: BERT/RoBERTa for text understanding
- 🔄 **Active Learning**: User feedback incorporation

#### **Long-term (3-6 months)**
- 📋 **Real-time Learning**: Online model updates
- 📋 **Multi-language**: Support for non-English tickets
- 📋 **Hierarchical Classification**: Issue type → urgency mapping

### **Performance Benchmarks**
```
Current vs Industry Standards:
✅ Issue Classification: 94.1% (Industry: 85-95%)
⚠️ Urgency Prediction: 37.9% (Industry: 70-85%)
✅ Entity Extraction: ~85% (Industry: 80-90%)
✅ Processing Speed: 200ms (Industry: <500ms)
